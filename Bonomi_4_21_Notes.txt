8-10 runs
10 vectors in the attack
sample 5 from the test set
sample 5 from the training set
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THESE ARE RANDOM

DO MULTIPLE RUNS

Store the data in a dataframe
For every run store, th, k, prec, recall, acc
Can then use directly with Seaborn

PLOT RESULTS WITH A 95% CONFIDENCE InteRVAL
^ Can do this with built in function in Python

MITIGATION STRATEGIES
Generalize or apply pertrubations (DP)
Two ways to do DP
Dataset is very small, so just adding noise is gonna ruin the usuabliity of the data
Thus, pertrub each individual data element
1. Each real valued element, we add some Laplace noise, this will obfuscate the original record
2. Local DP model --> This is what Apple/Google use, for mobile devices. There's a paper about it

Then run the distance based attack

Challenges we have run into
- Mobile data is very diverse
- We are only using 1 column of the data
 -- Could genrelizae a mitigation
 -- The activity of each column are correlated
-> Solution: Learn the correleation between acticityies, Protect A and then use a statistical model to reconstruct 
Post processing part, generating a new synthetic dataset
REONCSTRUCT DEPENDENT ATTRIBUTES

How to prioritize final days
- Show data is quite unique
- Show results of distance based attack, with multiple random runs
- Evaluate mitigation stratgies
- Read the paper, try to understand how the model is different from DP, how the setting in that paper is different/the same as ourpaper
- Check with Brad is presentaiton is the final reu

Sample at random (for the testing set) 5%, thus we are sharing the other 95%
Take 5% from the training set to complement the testing set

Attacker has access to clean data, but has to match it with the pertrubed dataset (the shared dataset is sanitized)

Emphasize the motivations --> ALSO WHAT ARE OUR AIMS< how did we decompose the project, goals at every step
Conclusions then open questions / future work

SHOW THE MECHANISM SATISFIES DP --> Include a short proof in the final report
